- Explain how you ensure user is the right one starting the app

In order to authenticate correctly the user of the app, I used biometric authentication. The user can either use his fingerprint or his phone's PIN code if 
he does'nt have a touch sensor. By doing so, I don't have to store any kind of username or password which could be easily stolen.
